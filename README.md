## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application. 

_Warning: It is not an professional product. Some functions in here aren't made by the most "flutterest" way, but comments should keep you on road._

The navigation is super easy. In case, here it how it works:
* Answer yes to the two questions
* Click on the timer to set it up
* Click on _start_ to begin the timer
* After 5 seconds, a first call is made and the result is displayed
* Then, it will call back the api according to your timer's preferences
* Click _stop_ to stop the timer and reset the timer

And that's it, enjoy!
